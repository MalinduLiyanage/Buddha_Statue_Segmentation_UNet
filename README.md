<h1>U - Net based Statue object segmentation Research Component</h1>

<p>The customized U â€“ Net Architecture is trained for 200 seated Buddha statue images found on Google, and their corresponding binary masks that to segment the validated user input image. A detailed description of model training has stated in the section 04.02 of submitted EC04 Document.</p>

        <th>Process in Brief</th>
        <td>After the user image is fed to the system as an input, it identifies statue object from the image and creates a binary mask for the object itself. Then subtract the masked area from the original image by leaving a background removed statue object as the output.</td>
